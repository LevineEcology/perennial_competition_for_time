1. Knapp et al. 2002, Science: "Rainfall variability, carbon cycling, and plant species diversity in a mesic grassland"
   - altered timing of rainfall (removed all rainfall and added it infrequently)
   - did not alter amount of rainfall
   - longer interrain intervals increased diversity
2. Smith et al. 2016, Jn of Applied Ecol.: "Rainfall variability and nitrogen addition synergistically reduce plant diversity in a restored tallgrass prairie"
   - altered timing of rainfall (removed 50% of all rainfall and added it at end of month)
   - did not alter the amount of rainfall
   - variability treatment decreased diversity (also made SWC higher on average, so a bit weird. )
3. Perez-Camacho et al. 2012, Functional Ecology: "Plant functional trait responses to interannual rainfall variability, summer drought, and seasonal grazing in Mediterranean herbaceous communities"
   - 3 treatments: all-year irrigation, fall/spring irrigation with summer drought, control -- irrigation kept SWC above 20%
   - did not measure diversity, just cover of perennial and annual spp
4. Vargas-Colin et al 2022, Plant ecology and diversity: "Changes in rainfall amount and seasonality modulate taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in a gypsophilous plant community in the Chihuahuan Desert"
   - did not alter rainfall timing (in the way we need)
   - did alter rainfall amount
   - increased rainfall amount led to increased diversity.
