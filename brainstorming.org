* Changing interactions

- A spatially implicitly model of space (temporally implicit model of time).
- This is because it is governed by patterns of resource availability, which are what we expect to vary in both space and time.
- While we understand the conditions that allow coexistence in a world with spatial variation in the environment (and therefore in interactions), we don't understand how these patterns are expected to change spatially.

* Possible directions:
1. A theory of biomes/biogeography that incorporates species interactions ?
2. A theory of community response to climate change/biodiversity loss that incorporates species interactions explicitly ?
3. A principled way to examine spatial variation in coexistence ?
4. Species richness distributions ?
